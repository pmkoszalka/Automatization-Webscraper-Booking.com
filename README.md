# Automatization-Webscraper-Booking.com
The project allows automate and web scrape booking.com. <br />

Inspiration from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7VZsCCnptM&t=8132s; freecoderscamp and JimShapedCoding. <br />

My exclusive input: Changing the way project is structured, allows to search for dates that are futher down the Calendar, uses pandas df as a reporting method and introduces KPI that helps to choose the best deal. <br />

The reason for the project: helped me to understand how to properly structure files within project, practicing Object Oriented Programing in Python, practicing selenium as an automatization/data scraping tool.
